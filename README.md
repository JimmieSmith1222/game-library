Future features: I want to add search funcionality to my app as well as some CSS to really style it and make it look better. There are a multitude of future features I could do with this but for now that will be next.

Where I am leaving off or rather notes to self: Finished making a functioning app and next will be CSS and adding a search function. Dont forget future me.
